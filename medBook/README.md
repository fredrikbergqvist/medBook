# MedBook

Project in Angular 2 with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

I only added tests for (DoctorService).


## To run and build
- Start the API-server (see the PDF in the api folder
- `ng serve` --> `http://localhost:4200/`
- Tests should be run with `ng test` but I didn not get it to work so I ran them in Webstorm
